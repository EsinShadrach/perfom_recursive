I was and I'm half asleep making and pushing this, this is just a rust program to find all directories starting witbh the wiord fudwud and run git clean -Xfd to remove all untrakkded files (i was cleaning up my laptop and fudwud is the name of where i worked at which i built a lot of projects so all projects from there comes with the prefix fudwud, [i don't wnat to forget to push this later and this culd be useful if you can passing grep or something to run batches and run git clean or recursively enter git folders and run clean]
